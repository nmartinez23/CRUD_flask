# CRUD User List App

My code in this repo is from the Codementor.io 4 week course I took in May 2016.

The following were used to build out the application.

* Language - Python and Jinja2 template.
* Framework - Flask
* Database - SQLAlchemy

## Test the application

Clone or download the files and open the desired HTML file in your browser. To make changes to the app, you will need to modify the app.py file.
